WebGL Now Playing Hack
======================

![Obligatory 10mb gif](kung10mb.gif)

A example of how to use the newly released [Spotify Connect Web APIs](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/web-api-connect-endpoint-reference/) to render the currently playing artwork in a slightly different way using WebGL.

Just open [index.html](index.html) and it should ask you for permission to know what you are currently playing and to control playback.

While it's running, you can click on the progress bar/scrubber to seek in the track, or use your keyboard to control playback, `space` toggles play/pause, `left` skips to the previous track, `right` skips to the next track.

Enjoy.
